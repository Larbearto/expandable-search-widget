- Upon initial load I only want to display a button with a search icon.
- Clicking the icon will slid out the search input to full width.
- The component should be fluid and can be used in a responsive context.
- After typing a search item, I want to be able to submit the form and by either clicking 'enter' or clicking on the search icon.
- If the search input is expanded and also empty, upon clicking the search icon I want the input to close again.
- I also want the input to close when clicking outside the search bar whether it's empty or not.
- Without javascript I want the search bar to be shown expanded.
- Optional, add touch events.

HTML:

- main container, a form, the text and submit inputs and a span for the icon.
